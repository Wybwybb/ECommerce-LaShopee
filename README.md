E-Commerce Website Project
This repository contains our E-Commerce Website Project, developed as part of our boot camp. The project serves as a practical application of the concepts and skills we learned throughout the course, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to design and develop a simple yet functional e-commerce website. It showcases essential features that mimic a real-world shopping platform, allowing users to:

View Products - Browse a list of products with images and descriptions.
Add to Cart - Select and add products to a shopping cart.
View Cart - Review selected items in the cart through a modal.
Checkout Functionality - Complete the shopping process with a checkout option.
Delete Items - Remove unwanted products from the cart.
Features and Functionalities

Interactive buttons for adding to the cart, deleting items, and checking out.
Cart Modal:

A pop-up modal displaying the items added to the cart.
